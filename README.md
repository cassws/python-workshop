# Resources for Python 101 workshop ([link to Github)](https://github.com/zoews/PythonWorkshop)

## Workshop tools

[repl.it](https://repl.it/) - tool for writing and compiling Python directly in the browser (select *Python3* when using)

## Using raw data in Repl.it

To use the Buffy data in the workshop today, you'll need to create a new file on Repl.it:
* Click on the New File icon. The first time you click, this will generate a name for your main working Python file (main.py)
* Click a second time. You can name this file buffy.py (in Python, additional files are called *modules*)
* Copy the text from [buffyRawScript.py](https://github.com/zoews/PythonWorkshop/blob/master/buffyScriptRaw.py) and paste it into your new *buffy.py* file.
* Now navigate back to main.py. In order to use the data from buffy.py in your main file, simply add the following code to the top of your file: `from buffy import script` *Note: when importing from modules, you ignore the '.py' ending and simply write the filename without the extension*
